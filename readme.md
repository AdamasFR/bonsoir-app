# Bonsoir !

Ou Bonjour ? O Buenas Tardes ? Or Good evening ?

It happens to every last one of us. You want to greet somebody and you say "Good Day !" and they respond "Good Evening" because it's 18h30 and, yeah, it's night already. It's weird right?

Your website don't usually make this distinction when it greets people, it just go "Hello !" and that's it. What if you could use the **ABSOLUTE POWER** of Javascript to serve the right word, in the right language, at the right time ?!! Yep, that's it, we did it reddit.
